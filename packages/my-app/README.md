# My app

The purpose of this app is to push some ideas especially foundational level functionalities of Expo along with Storybook.

Some high level ideas:

1. expo-update updates
2. splash-screen with some sort of loader that ties into expo-update
3. popup if there's a new update while the app is running
4. push notification registration
5. send notification registration
6. i18n and switching
7. dark/light mode switch
8. local authentication
9. Google Authentication (maybe?)
10. Apple Authentication (maybe?)

Crazier ideas later:

1. custom Expo Update server? Maybe I'll add it in as another package.

What would be in this app:

1. expo-router screens
2. assets
3. Stories on the screen level??? does that even make sense?

What won't be in this app:

1. Components, moved to react-native-my-components
2. Component level stories. They're in react-native-my-components.
