/**
 * Expo PDF Viewer.  The way it works is that this renders a single page utilizing PDF.js running inside a canvas in a WebView.   It then leverages the WebView
 * capability of exporting the canvas to a data URI to an image thus allowing scaling.  The zooming and paging of the content is out of the scope
 * of the viewer though.
